find all the info for all moves in the game
    Some moves are currently missing their effects data. Get that, and make a constructor to take in the appropriate amount of detail, if one doesnt already exist

No day care system. Should generate eggs, and give each pokemon exp each second its inside, until I figure out a way to record players footsteps. 
    Probably need colliders on the bottom of the feet.
    
Mart system doesnt exists. Have separate menus players can buy from, depending on how many badges they have.

TODO Dialogue
    Not sure where, but I broke this. Dialogue Lines arent being displayed properly, and the dialogue and be combined to form strange text

TODO Pokemon center
    The pokemon center straight up doesnt exist. Fix that

TODO Items
    Currently only the pokeball and recovery items have a class. Implement the other item types
   
TODO Player Party Editor
    Currently when looking at the player's party, it only shows the pokemon data. Show the entire pokemon or egg instead
   
TODO Pokemon class
    Once a pokemon levels up, check if they can learn a new move, and if the pokemon can, prompt the player to choose whether they will or not.
    
TODO Controls
    Only have a few controls set up for a controller
        Add support for a keyboard
        Add controller support for any menu
