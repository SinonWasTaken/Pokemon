find all the info for all moves in the game
    Some moves are currently missing their effects data. Get that, and make a constructor to take in the appropriate amount of detail, if one doesnt already exist
    
Move it missing basically all of its data.
    
Find all the information on each pokemon.
    PokemonData does not have a class that stores the pokemons entire moveset. Create that soon
    Pokemon does not have an array of 4 moves for the pokemon to use. It is also missing alot of its methods. No exp, leveling or move finding.
    
The pokemon generation class needs alot of work. Only one constructor, and it does absolutely nothing.

No day care system. Should generate egss, and give each pokemon exp each second its inside, until I figure out a way to record players footsteps. 
    Probably need colliders on the bottom of the feet.
    
Mart system doesnt exists. Have seperate menus players can buy from, depending on how many badges they have.

Poke center doesnt exist.

Items don't exist. Need the data classes. Pokemon ball, Healing items and items that pokemon can hold are the only items that will have seperate classes.
